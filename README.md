# TASK_1
DATA PREPROCESSING

Removed missing values and duplicate rows to ensure data quality.

Standardized column names to lowercase with underscores (e.g., annual_income_(k$)).

Cleaned and normalized text fields like gender (e.g., Male â†’ male).

Converted data types: age to integer, annual_income_(k$) to numeric.

Saved the cleaned dataset as Cleaned_Mall_Customers.csv for further analysis.
